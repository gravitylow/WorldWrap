#World Wrap configuration file 
#For each world you want to use with World Wrap, please copy the template below and replace "world" with the world's name 
#Please consult http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldwrap/ for questions

General Settings:
    #Should mobs follow the same rules as players? (Note, this only works on bottom teleportation)
    Mobs follow rules: true
    
    #Do you want to use EXPERMINTAL mob rules? This allows mobs to follow top, bottom, and edge rules
    #THERE IS A REASON THIS FALSE BY DEFAULT AND MARKED AS EXPERIMENTAL, Please, for the LOVE OF GOD, do not use this unless you have a blank map and feel like ruining it.
    #While it does to pretty awesome stuff, it can and will do HORRIBLE things to your server if it is not powerful enough
    #Or you have too many worlds loaded (even one is enough to lag out a normal server)
    #This is for testing ONLY, please do not use it if you like your users and your map.
    Experimental rules: false
